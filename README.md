# bigquery_googleanalytics
A lot of digital analyst have worked on Google analytics or Adobe Analytics but they don't have enough experience with SQL or Big Query. I faced the same issue and while there were enough tutorial online, I didnt find one which gave instructions on how to effectively use SQL for the GA 360 dataset. This is my attempt to create this tutorial.

We go from knowing nothing about SQL to writing advanced scripts for finding user cohorts and purchase behavior.
